# DBWatson

A practical extension to DBSherlock that adds GPT-4 capabilities for better anomaly detection

## About

Building on the DBSherlock project from UMich (original repo is [here](https://github.com/dongyoungy/dbsherlock-reproducibility)) and linked it to GPT-4. The original tool was already great at identifying performance issues in databases, we were able to improve it by connecting it to GPT-4.

## What's new?

We added three main things:
- The system now learns from past incidents (not just raw stats)
- Better rules for catching problems (by combining DBSherlock's statistical approach with GPT-4's insights)
- Plain English explanations of what went wrong (rather than data dumps)

## Results

### Original DBSherlock
Here's what the original could do (these graphs are from the UMich paper):

### Improvements
After integrating GPT-4 into DBSherlock's analysis pipeline, we observed significant improvements:

- **Enhanced Detection Accuracy**: 
  - Average confidence scores above 70% across most test cases
  - F-scores consistently matching or exceeding confidence levels
  - Strong correlation (RÂ² = 0.932) between confidence and F-scores

- **Case-Specific Performance**:
  - Best Performance: Physical design issues (90%+ confidence, 95% F-score)
  - Strong Detection: Network congestion and CPU saturation cases (80%+ on both metrics)
  - Reliable Performance: Most operational scenarios maintained 60-80% accuracy
  - Areas for Improvement: Lock contention cases (~40% confidence)

- **Distribution Analysis**:
  - Consistent performance across different anomaly types
  - Narrow confidence intervals in detection accuracy
  - Balanced precision-recall trade-off in anomaly classification

*Comprehensive analysis of LLM-enhanced detection showing performance by case type, correlation metrics, and score distributions*

These results shoow that LLM integration significantly improves DBSherlock's ability to identify and explain database performance anomalies, especially in complex scenarios involving physical design and resource utilization issues.

## Setting Up

### Software:
- MATLAB R2015b or newer 
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Get the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymorsi7/db-watson.git
cd db-watson
```

2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

3. Get the data:
- Grab the original DBSherlock datasets from their repo
- Put them in `data/dbsherlock/`
- Our extended datasets go in `data/db-watson/`

## Running Code:

```bash
cd experiments/dbsherlock
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run_baseline_experiments"
```
